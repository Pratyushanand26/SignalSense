So, I mean, I've been around code for a while. You know, not exactly six years, more like something that adds up if you count all the little gigs. I did a lot of debugging, sometimes full modules, sometimes just fixes, little patches here and there. People say lead, but I think it's easier to say that than to explain all the back and forth. It's complicated. Maybe three-ish if you only count the proper stuff.
