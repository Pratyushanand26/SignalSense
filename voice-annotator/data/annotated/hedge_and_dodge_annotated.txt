[000.07] so /pause_0.54s/ i mean i've /tremor/ been around code /tremor/ for /pause_0.42s/ a while /tremor/ /pause_0.75s/ you /tremor/ know /tremor/ not exactly /tremor/ six years /tremor/ more /tremor/ like /pause_0.78s/ something /tremor/ that adds /tremor/ up /tremor/ if you /tremor/ count /tremor/ all the /tremor/ little gigs /tremor/ /pause_1.38s/ i
[014.26] did /tremor/ a /cutoff/ lot of <unk> /tremor/ sometimes /tremor/ full modules sometimes just /pause_0.45s/ fixes little /tremor/ patches here /tremor/ and there /pause_1.68s/ people /tremor/
[022.86] say /tremor/ lead /tremor/ but /cutoff/ i
[023.64] think /tremor/ it's easier to say that than /tremor/ to /tremor/ explain /tremor/ all the back /tremor/ and /tremor/ forth /tremor/ /pause_1.26s/ it's /tremor/
[028.48] complicated /tremor/ /pause_0.96s/ maybe three /tremor/ ish if /tremor/ you only count /tremor/ the proper /tremor/ stuff /pause_2.13s/
